Specifically, you will use data from a global, 300m resolution land-use, land-cover (LULC) map produced by ESACCI. They provide a wonderful time series of data from 1992-2019. If you want more information, check out their web viewer at https://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/. Here you can view the data but also learn more about the classification regressions that uses time-series spectral data patterns to classify grid-cells into different types. I have extracted lulc maps for the country of Rwanda, which you will find in this assignment's data folder.\n\n\n\n\nThis question tests some basic python comprehension.\n\nThroughout, use comments to explain steps you are doing. No need to go overboard but it is always important in coding to be as descriptive as possible.\n\nMost things in this can be solved using methods shown in lecture. However, some cases will require you to search the internet for answers. This is intended because efficiently searching documentation or Stackoverflow is a requirement of modern programing.\n\nSubsequent questions will be specific to big data, statistics and economics, but for now we are just checking that you're okay with the basics of Python.\n\n**Part A:** Write a python function that calculates the sum of all squared \nnumbers from 1 to x. Illustrate that it works for x = 20.\n\nHINT, ** is the exponent operator in python.\nHINT syntax for a python function is:\n\ndef function_name(variable_name):\n    outcome = variable_name + 1\n    return outcome\n\nThe python library named \"os\" is a built-in library for dealing with any file on your operating system.\nOften, research tasks involve LOTS of files and you need to iterate over them. To show you know how\nto do this, use the os.listdir function to answer the following questions. Note that you need to \nwrite \"import os\" to import the library into your code before you can use it:\n\n**Part B:** Print out a list of all the files in the class repository (which you have gotten from GitHub).\nI don't care how many are actually there (in case you've added some yourself) but show me how.\n\n**Part C:** Using a FOR loop, iterate over the list from above. Using the function len(), count how many letters there are in the filenames. HINT just like in real life, you may need to google the len() function and see how it work on e.g. strings.\n\n**Part D:** Write a Python program which iterates over the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print \"Fizz\" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print \"Buzz\". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print \"FizzBuzz\". Hint: look up how to use the modulo operator (which is written as % in python) which would let you test when the remainder of a devision is exactly 0.\n\nSide-note, this is a hilariously over-used question that most software engineers get askedon their first interview for a job.\n\n## Question 2\n\nPart a.) Using the gdal package and the gdal.Open() function, open up the land-use, land-cover map for Rwanda in 2000. \n\nIn this file, there is only 1 band in this file, so you can also access it with the GetRasterBand(1) function. Without reading the whole array, show how you can determine how many total grid-cells there are in this country.\n\nPart b.) Using the results of part a, read the whole array into memory as a numpy array (the default option when using the ReadAsArray() funciton, and plot it using the matplotlib imshow command. Add a nice title to the plot describing what it is.\n\n\nPart c.) Using the legend you find at https://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/download/ESACCI-LC-QuickUserGuide-LC-Maps_v2-0-7.pdf reclassify the LULC into a simplified map where 1 = cropland (including any mosaic types that are partially cropland) and 0 = anything else. Plot this using imshow.\n\n\n\n\nPart d.) Repeat the process for the 2010 LULC map. Using this array with the one from part c, create a new array that records where there was cropland expansion (i.e., there is cropland in 2010 but not in 2000) and where there was cropland abandonment (cropland in 2000 but not in 2010). Save this classification in a single new array. Plot this last array. Optionally, add a legend indicating which values in the array denote expansion and abandonment using some variant of `ax.legend()`\n\n\n\nPart e.) Overall, did Rwanada see net expansion or contraction of cropland over this period? Looking at the spatial results, do you see any patterns of where this happens? Is it in the north/south, near cities, replacing forests etc.?\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n\nFor this assignment, you will be using numpy to manipulate arrays in a way that works well for big data and will be using spatial tools to assess land-use change.
